# 100 Days of RTL Challenge Solutions

## Introduction

This repository hosts my solutions to the **100 Days of RTL** challenge, a hands-on and highly practical course curated by Rahul Behl on QuickSilicon. The challenge consists of a structured series of daily exercises covering RTL design principles, coding techniques, and verification methodologies, ranging from basic modules like multiplexers to advanced topics such as formal verification and UVM-based testbenches. ([github.com](https://github.com/raulbehl/100DaysOfRTL), [quicksilicon.in](https://quicksilicon.in/))

## Challenge Overview

* **Duration**: 100 days of exercises.
* **Content Areas**:

  * **RTL Design**: Fundamental to advanced Verilog/SystemVerilog constructs.
  * **Testbench Development**: Introduction to SystemVerilog testbenches, randomization, interfaces, and advanced verification features.
  * **Formal Verification**: Equivalence checking and property-based proofs.
  * **UVM Methodology**: Building UVM drivers, sequencers, and testbenches.
  * **Advanced Topics**: Covering various EDA tools and methodologies.
